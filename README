Continuation of Nijikokun's amazing Permissions system.  Unfortunately I am nowhere near as good of a developer or as seasoned
with Java as he is so the work will be slow going.  Right now there are also several other developers all working on the same
thing with everyone attempting to resurect this plugin and all of his others.  This constitutes my contributions to the effort.

Please keep in mind I am still in the process of learning Java so some things may seem amateurish or not make sense.  Unfortunately
most of my experience with Java is on smaller single user GUI applications that are nowhere near as robust as this.
