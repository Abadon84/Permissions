Permissions... Done right.
Permissions allows plugin-authors to utalize a permission system that handles 
group inheritance, globalized permission settings, and more. All the features 
of a fine-grained permission system in one plugin.

This is a continuation of the work that was originally done by Nijikokun.  All
original credit goes to them as without their work this plugin would not have
been possible.

Features
Groups
Group Inheritance, Allows for groups to gain permissions from other groups.
User Permission System
Fine Grained Permission system.
Allowing for Globalized permissions
Easy to use, setup, and implement.
Two cache layers, first from file to memory, then from memory to cache.
Plugins can control cache since version 2.1
And much more.
For the users


Permissions gives server admins great control, mostly in-game reloading. Simply use 
/permissions -reload all and the file will be re-cached and never touched again until 
you need to reload it. This allows you to quickly give your users the commands that 
they need without having to restart the server.
